            <h4>Power Washing</h4>
            <p>
              Maybe you're wondering what power washing is and how different it
              is from pressure washing.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Power washing is a method of cleaning by using hot water to remove
              build-up dirt such as grime, mold, or algae. It can even remove
              gums off. It used for cleaing surface tops, your driveway, and
              walkway.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              How is it different from pressure washing then ?
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Power washing uses hot water that helps eliminate bacteria,
              something that pressure washing cannot do. You surely want to get
              rid of those unsightly rust stains and gross molds and stick
              everywhere in your home.
            </p>
